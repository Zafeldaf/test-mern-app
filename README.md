# Project #1: Full Stack CRUD REST API

This is the first full project in my journey of learning JavaScript and by now I have an intermediate grasp on React,
Express and Node.js and some of the packages and libraries I used with these frameworks. I have done other 2 other
projects, but they weren't complete in the sense fullstack applications and my usage of the JavaScript wasn't optimal,
and so I decided not to push them here.

## React

This is what I learnt in react when I started it.

1. React Basics
2. Props, Components
3. Use State, Use Effect
4. React Libraries, MUI Library
5. Vite
6. Axios, API Calling
7. CRUD Creation

## Express & Node.js

This is what I learnt in Express and Node.js when I started. I didn't learn the basics by reading the documentation or
watching a crash course on them, but rather by creating a project. The project was creating basic user authentication,
which included the user signing up, signing in, signing out and changing his profile.

Something's I learnt:

1. Basics of Express and Node.js
2. How to write backend code
3. Usage of bcrypt to hash the passwords of users
4. Mongodb integration with the backend via mongoose and jwt authentication
5. Storing the user data locally via cookies and usage of localstorage
